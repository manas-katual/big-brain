Uplink : [[Python]]

## Start

First Program
```py
print("Hello World!")
```
here print is a [[function]] in python and whatever we write in the double quotes is a treated as text ([[string]]) in python. For example we can print anything inside within double quotes

## Python Character Set

- Letters – A to Z, a to z
- Digits – 0 to 9
- Special Symbols `- + - * / etc.`
- Whitespaces – Blank Space, tab, carriage return, newline, formfeed
- Other characters – Python can process all ASCII and Unicode characters as part of data or literals

To print numbers in python we don't use double quotes it will print but it will be treated as a text ([[string]]) not number 
```py
print(25)
print(36)
```

we can add two numbers ([[int]]) or can perform any arithmetic operations
```py
print(35 + 36)
```
