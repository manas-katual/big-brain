- OSI model is also known as OSI Reference Model, 7 Layer Model
- OSI model and TCP/IP model both were being designed at the same time
- So there isn't anything like who came first.
- OSI Model is like a Electric Engineer who have a degree and and lot of bookish knowledge but don't have any practical knowledge.
- TCP/IP is like a bijliwala who doesn't have any degree nor have any bookish knowledge but have lot of practical knowledge.
- OSI model is used as book or for theory Knowledge.
- TCP/IP is used as a practical and is implemented all over the world.
- OSI Model came because there was not any communication medium between computers which are in located in different countries.
- e.g. computers in Russia cannot communicate with computers located in USA.
- So this OSI Model was made to communicate between them but this does not get implemented TCP/IP got implemented instead of this.
