Features of a language are nothing but services/facilities provided by language developers in the language, which are used by language programmers for developing real-time applications.

1. Simple and Easy to learn
2. Freeware and Opensource
3. Dynamically programming Language
4. Platform Independent Language
5. Portable
6. Interpreted Programming Language
7. High Level Programming Language
8. Procedural and Object Oriented
9. Robust
10. Extensible Programming Language
11. Embedded Programming Language
12. Support Third party API's


## Simple and Easy to learn

- Python is a simple programming Language when we read python program, we can feel like reading English statement.
- Python language provides rich set of modules or API's.
- Python programming provides in-built facility [[garbage collector]], which collects un-used memory space and improves the performance of python based application.

**Definition of Garbage Collector :-** 
- A garbage collector is one of software component in Python software, which is running in the background of regular python program whose role is to collect/remove un-used memory space 
- Hence, Garbage collector is taking care about Automatic Memory Management
- Python provides developer friendly syntaxes so that we develop error free programs in a limited spoon of time.


## Freeware and Opensource

- We can use python software without any license and it is freeware.
- It's source code is open, so that we can customize based on our requirement.
- The father of python G.V Rossum developed CPYTHON.
- The CPYTHON is customized by many companies called "Python Distribution"
- There are lots of python distribution : -
	1. Jython or JPython :- used for running java based applications. 
	2. Iron python or IPython :- used for running C#, .Net Application.
	3. MicroPython :- Used for developing micro controllers.
	4. Anaconda Python :- Used for running bigdata/hadoop applications. 
	5. Ruby python :- Used for running ruby based applications.
	6. PyPy
	7. StacKless Python
